# deep-learning-image-classification
This project demonstrates the implementation of a deep learning pipeline for image classification and face recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN). It is designed to detect human faces in images, preprocess the input data, train a custom CNN model for classification, and visualize the results.
