# deep-learning-image-classification: Facial Recognition using CNN and MTCNN

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a deep learning pipeline for image classification and face recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN). It is designed to detect human faces in images, preprocess the input data, train a custom CNN model for classification, and visualize the results.

## Features
Facial Detection: Detect faces in an input image using MTCNN.
Facial Recognition: Classify detected faces using a custom CNN model architecture.
Visualization: Display processed images with recognized faces highlighted with bounding boxes.

## Requirements
This project is designed to run on Google Colab. To ensure compatibility and ease of execution, the following Python libraries are required:

- tensorflow (Deep Learning frameworks)
- opencv-python (Image-processing library)
- mtcnn (Face detection module)
- matplotlib (Visualization library)
Install these dependencies using the following command:

!pip install tensorflow opencv-python mtcnn
